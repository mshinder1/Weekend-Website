	<p>This weekend, my friends and I went out to Long Island. We left on Friday night. After dinner, we watched <i>Mean Girls</i>. On Saturday it was cloudy so we stayed inside for most of the time. My friend taught my other friend and I how to play a card game called Pit. We went swimming after for about an hour and a half. Then we helped my stepmom Katie with dinner. We had vegetable kebabs, corn, rice pilaf, and chicken, although I didn't have any. Also, my friends brought me cupcakes and teas as a present so we made tea before dinner. That night was the most fun of the entire trip. We decided that we wanted to sleep in the basement that night. One of my friendsalso loved horror films, even though the other was skeptical. So we decided that we would watch a horror film and then a chill movie so that we could go to sleep. So first, we wanted to watch <i>Paranormal Activiy</i>, but they didn't have it on demand. Then, we tried to watch <i>The Shining</i>. I had already seen it before so the deal was if we ran out of popcorn, I would got get it. But they didn't have that on demand either. Then we tried to watch <i>Friday the 13th</i>, but they only had the 5th one which looked terrible. We watched 2 trailers for movies called <i>Trick 'r Treat</i> and <i>The Witch</i>, but they didnt look good. Finally, we decided on <i>Krampus</i>because my friend and I had wanted to see it anyway. It was perfect because it was horrifying, but it was so stupid that it was funny, and there was a really big jump scare at the end. We also ate the cupcakes that my friend gave us. Afterwards, we watched <i>Clueless</i>. The next day, we went to the diner and then to the beach. We all swam in the ocean for most of the time. Then we had to go home. Overall, it was a great weekend with my friends.</p>
